###Creating an issue or a pull request

We encourage people to help with the project so it will include as much content as possible to help players more and more but there are a few things that you need to know before submitting a bug report or creating a pull request to add a feature.

When creating an issue:

* Make sure that the title describes the issue as best as possible without being too long. Titles such as "Wiki broken" are not good.
* Be clear and concise in your description. More detailed information is always great and helps us a lot more than just saying "it's not working".
* Search the issue tracker to ensure that your issue is not a duplicate.
* Use a *vanilla* environment, making sure to remove any browser extensions which may be causing the issue in the first place.
* Do not bump issues to receive a response. All issues are seen.
* Do not argue unproductively in an issues or pull requests comments.
* Do not re-create an issue you feel unjustly closed. You can comment on the closed one.
* Do not create disrespectful or inflammatory comments.
* Please avoid commenting on issues with "+1" or such. Try to give constructive criticism.
* Content should be grammatically correct and the spelling should be US English (for English content), e.g. Color not Colour.

When creating a pull request make sure to follow the above. In the code it self, please make sure that it is properly formatted.
